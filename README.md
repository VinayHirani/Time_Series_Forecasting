# Time_Series_Forecasting
Time Series analysis and forecasting using ARMA,ARIMA,SARIMAX

I have used the dataset of CO2 Emissions form various different Sources, Which includes the total CO2 Emission in million metrics ton. 
Solely focused on forecasting the total CO2 Emissions for 1 year into the future. Using various methods such as 
1.Simple Exponential Smoothing 
2. Holt - Winters Methods 
3. auto_arima to find optimal parameters to be used for SARIMA Model 
4. Sesonal_Decompose to check for seasonality and trend.
